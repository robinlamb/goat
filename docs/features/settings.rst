Settings
========

GOAT provides a default settings screen, available when the player
presses Esc while in ``EXPLORING`` mode. Currently, only the most
important settings are supported. The settings file (INI-style) is saved
in ``user://settings.cfg``. When the program runs for the first time,
the file is created with the default values.

|Settings screen|

======== =================== =============
Section  Key                 Default value
======== =================== =============
graphics fullscreen_enabled  true
graphics glow_enabled        true
graphics reflections_enabled true
graphics shadows_enabled     true
sound    music_volume        1.0
sound    effects_volume      1.0
controls mouse_sensitivity   0.3
======== =================== =============

**Note: the volume is a value between 0 (complete silence) and 1
(default bus volume), which is recalculated to a non-linear value between
-80 and 0 dB (using a linear value causes the sound to almost vanish long
before the volume slider reaches minimum). Mouse sensitivity is used
for player's camera rotation and inventory item rotation.**

In order to react to changes in settings, you can connect to a signal:

::

   goat_settings.value_changed (section, key)

Methods for reading and modifying the values are also available:

::

   goat_settings.get_value(section, key)
   goat_settings.set_value(section, key, value)

By default, any change will emit a signal and save the settings file.
You can prevent the file saving:

::

   goat_settings.autosave = false
